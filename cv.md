I studied at Ural State University at the Faculty of Biology, but I have never worked in my specialty. After the birth of the child, I decided to change my professional activity. I have always had a penchant for exact sciences and the ability to think logically. Therefore, it seems to me that programming is very suitable for the realization of my talents and aspirations.
